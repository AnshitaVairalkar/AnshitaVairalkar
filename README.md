Quantitative Finance | Risk Modeling | Options & Volatility

---

## About
I am a Maths & Computing undergraduate with a strong interest in quantitative finance, 
risk modeling, and derivatives markets.

My work focuses on understanding market behavior through probability, statistics, 
and systematic modeling rather than discretionary intuition.

---

## Areas of Focus
- Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (CVaR)
- Monte Carlo simulation methods
- Options pricing and Greeks analysis
- Volatility dynamics and tail risk
- Time-series analysis and backtesting
- Risk-adjusted performance evaluation

---

## Technical Skills
**Programming**
- Python
- SQL

**Libraries & Tools**
- NumPy, Pandas
- SciPy, Statsmodels
- Matplotlib (research use)
- scikit-learn
- Interactive Brokers API (TWS / Gateway)
